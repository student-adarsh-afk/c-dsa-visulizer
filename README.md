🧠 DSA Visualizer (C – Terminal Edition)
DSA Visualizer is an open-source terminal-based tool that helps beginners learn and visualize core Data Structures and Algorithms using pure C — without any external libraries or graphics frameworks.

📌 Why This Project?
Understanding DSA isn't always easy by just reading theory. This project offers a visual and interactive way to see how stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and sorting algorithms work — all inside your terminal window.

🚀 What You'll Learn
By using or contributing to this project, you will gain hands-on experience with:

✅ Core DSA concepts: stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, sorting

✅ C programming best practices

✅ Using ANSI escape codes for basic terminal UI

✅ Writing clean, modular, and maintainable code

✅ Collaborating on open-source using Git and GitHub

🧰 Features
🔹 Fully written in C, no external dependencies

🔹 Cross-platform support via standard terminal

🔹 Simple but effective ASCII-based visualization

🔹 Organized and modular code structure

🔹 Open to contributors at all skill levels
