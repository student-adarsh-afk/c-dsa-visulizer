DSA Visualizer â€“ Terminal-Based Project in C
DSA Visualizer is a collaborative open-source project that aims to implement and visualize core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C, directly in the terminal â€” without any external libraries.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project helps beginners and intermediate programmers understand how DSA works internally by showing step-by-step visualizations directly in the terminal.

All components are written in pure C, using standard input/output, ANSI escape codes for simple visuals, and clean code architecture.

ðŸ”¹ Features
Terminal-based interactive interface

Pure C implementation (no external libraries)

Visualization of basic operations:

Push, Pop in Stack

Enqueue, Dequeue in Queue

Insert, Delete, Traverse in Linked List

Tree Traversals

Sorting Visuals (e.g., Bubble Sort)

Clean code and modular structure for easy contributions

ðŸ”¹ What Youâ€™ll Learn
By contributing or exploring this project, you will gain:

Deeper understanding of how DSA works under the hood

Skills in writing clean and modular C code

Techniques to build text-based UIs using terminal formatting

Hands-on experience with collaborative coding via Git/GitHub

Basics of version control and project structuring

ðŸ”¹ How to Contribute
We welcome contributions! You can:

Implement a new DSA visualization

Refactor existing code

Improve UI and UX (better prompts, highlighting, etc.)

Fix bugs or enhance performance
